# Arduino_arm_duco
A modified DUCO AVR miner code which works on the arduino nano 33 ble sense and similar devices which are ARM32 based.


It was made 50% with AI but it still works although when mining it appears not as an AVR but as an rp2040 and also when testing w2ith the Arduino nano 33 BLE sense i got around 14-15khs
